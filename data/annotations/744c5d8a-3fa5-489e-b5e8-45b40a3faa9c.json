I give it to you simply; that something has happened to shift the under-crust, there will be unpredictable results. This is under the ground. The way we are bound to each other, we are all so bound to each other through the air, and the fall out has come over Canada. This is also a part of the story that I heard yesterday, and you, I can see by your nods, you know this part of the story."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Voices","tag":"Speaking Voice"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Rukeyser"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Transcript"}],"uuid":"89639f22-e6ae-47b5-8c58-9c85a7696766"},{"start_time":1851,"end_time":2011,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"People were saying one thing, and then the other, about why don't we do this, why don't they do that--part of the story is that maybe nothing will fall because the Russians also wish to make underground tests. It's part of the ways in which we are bound to each other. I'll give you that. In Mexico, we are bound under the ground, over the ground, in every way there is. In Mexico, though the stories of what really happened to the students in October, and the stories of people-- of many students --were killed and the police were among the crowd, and the police wore one white glove or tied a handkerchief around their right hand, and when the helicopters came over, these white hands were put up that said \"don't shoot us, we're police.” Many students were shot, and they say in Mexico City that the bodies were incinerated, and no reports were made and no count was made. And these are the ways in which we are bound, too. And yes, I have been translating Octavio Paz, and Eikelof is another such poet, but Paz--the end of one of Octavio's poems--was printed on this issue of the University Student's Journal of the University of Mexico, with the account of September, October, November, December. And the poem ends like this in English. It's not as good, I warn you, these translations are a folly on a madness on a stupidity and at the same time one has to do it. As work to which one is driven, out of love and gratitude, and also out a motive not so noble as any of that. During the times in which one cannot write poems, it is wonderful to have something one cares about out in front of one, and work with it that way. And it's the thing, not spinning out of oneself in those times, but having something out in front. This is the end of the- of a great poem of Octavio Paz's called \"A Broken Jar.” And jar, of course--water jar--is something quite different in Mexico. We say 'jar.’ 'jug.’ something like that. It isn't in the thing we use every day, in Mexico, it's every day; it's that kind of broken jar."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Voices","tag":"Speaking Voice"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Rukeyser"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Transcript"}],"uuid":"6875f504-96ab-46a3-bc26-51684b2015d0"},{"start_time":2076,"end_time":2076,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"These are some poems, since my last book, and I don't know whether they are finished.

No. He's one of those people around Gauguin, and I said well, 'you can't print anything like that, people,' and then \"2001\"  was written and released, and \"2001\" has stargate, starbaby, the whole thing, and I put the name \"Next\" on this and I'm reading it to you partly for itself, but partly because one line of it is something I used in a poem I wrote when the same thing happened to many of us. The Olympics committee wrote to us and asked for poems, you know, for the games, or for the times of the games, or for something.
