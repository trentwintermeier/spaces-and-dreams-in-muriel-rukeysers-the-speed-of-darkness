    "title": "Spaces and Dreams in Muriel Rukeyser’s “The Speed of Darkness”",
    "description": "In 1969, American poet Muriel Rukeyser read a group of thirteen poems entitled “The Speed of Darkness” at Sir George Williams University. Rukeyser (1913-1980) was an American poet, essayist, and political activist whose work focused on topics such as labor, war, feminism, politics, and science. Her book and collection of poems, both titled \"The Speed of Darkness,\" was among her final publications. She famously wrote, here, \"The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.\"\n\nI argue in this project that digitally-annotating Rukeyser’s reading of the spaces between each stanza in this poem facilitates a new, sonic reading of the poem, one which is shaped through the practice of listening to duality in “The Speed of Darkness.”",
